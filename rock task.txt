Rock, Paper, Scissors

This is a popular hand game played between two people. Each player gets to form one of three shapes using their hand:

    rock (a closed fist)
    paper (a flat hand)
    scissors (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V)

Here's a youtube tutorial on coding up rock-paper-scissors in Python.
